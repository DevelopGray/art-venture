## About the Project

Art-Venture is inspired by the project YelpCamp but tailored to focus on public and private artworks. The platform allows users to:

- Browse a collection of artworks, including murals, sculptures, digital installations, and more.
- Add new artworks to the database with details like the title, artist, location, type, and optional images.
- Edit and delete existing artwork entries.
- Explore the rich diversity of art types via dynamic dropdowns and interactive forms.

This project is currently a work in progress and serves as a portfolio piece while learning full-stack web development.
